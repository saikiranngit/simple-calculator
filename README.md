# How It Works:
HTML: The structure of the calculator is created using a grid of buttons and an input field for the display.

CSS: Styling is applied to make the calculator visually appealing and responsive.

JavaScript: Functions handle button clicks, update the display, and perform calculations using the eval() function.

# Notes:
The eval() function is used here for simplicity, but it should be used cautiously in production as it can execute arbitrary code. For a more secure implementation, consider using a custom parser or library.

The calculator supports basic operations and includes a "DEL" button to delete the last character.

You can copy and paste the code into separate files (index.html, styles.css, and script.js) and open the index.html file in your browser to see the calculator in action.
